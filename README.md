# CMOS and Infrared Sensor Fusion (RGB-Thermal)
Remark: Before running the python scripts, make sure you are in the RGBT folder to make the coded relative path in this project to work!
## ToDo List

- [x] Finish literature review of both Object Detection and Fusion 
- [x] Find the conversion Matrix btw. RGB and IR Frame
- [x] Prepare the FLIR Dataset for fusion
- [x] Implement Scaled_Yolov4
- [x] Test the RGB frames from FLIR Dataset on Scaled_Yolov4 (Baseline)
- [x] Ablation Study for the Baseline
- [x] Dive deeper into SPP, PAN, FPN, DCN, SAM, GIOU and other relevant papers for Fusion
- [x] Design the Fusion Network
- [x] Start the Fusion Training
- [ ] Entropy-based Attention Module
