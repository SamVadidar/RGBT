# CMOS and Infrared Sensor Fusion (RGB-Thermal)
Remark: Before running the python scripts, make sure you are in the RGBT folder to make the coded relative path in this project to work!
## ToDo List

- [x] Finish literature review of both Object Detection and Fusion 
- [x] Find the conversion Matrix btw. RGB and IR Frame
- [x] Prepare the FLIR Dataset for fusion
- [ ] Implement Scaled_Yolov4
- [ ] Test the RGB frames from FLIR Dataset on Scaled_Yolov4 (Baseline)
- [ ] Fusion
